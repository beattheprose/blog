Starting up this blog is going to be an interesting endeavor. Can I do it, for one? Do people need it, for another?

Only time will tell.

However, I feel like I'm on the precipice of something important for myself personally. And what better way to celebrate that than with a tech blog. I'm a white guy after all.

Watch this space! I hope.
